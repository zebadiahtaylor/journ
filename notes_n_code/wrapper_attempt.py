idea: use @ decorators and wrappers to cut out the tedious opening and closing of code.
reality as it stands: 
1. conn is a global variable üò§ 
2. the wrapper can't close the database after returning something (unreachable code, see below),
which means conn.close() would have to be included in every function ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è halfway defeating the purpose of the wrappers ü§¨.
